Engine is created in `src/engines/<EngineName>Engine/` dir.
Main file is always `src/engines/<EngineName>Engine/<EngineName>Engine.ts`, containing exported `<EngineName>Engine` class.

## Typical engine template
import { MestoApp as App } from '@/App'

```
export class <EngineName>Engine {
  readonly type = '<engineName>';

  constructor(readonly app: App) {}

  // add public engine-specific methods - which are supposed to be frequently-used by other engines; if they exist


}
```

## Mounting engine

It should be mounted to [Engines.ts](mdc:mesto-clubeeo-back/src/Engines.ts)

```
// ...
  @PushTo('enabledEngines')
  @Once()
  get <engineName>() {
    return new <EngineName>Engine(this.app);
  }
// ...
```

Create an mdc file with information about `src/engines/<EngineName>Engine/.cursor/rules/<EngineName>Engine.mdc`.
